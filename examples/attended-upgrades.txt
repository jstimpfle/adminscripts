This example shows how to upgrade many clients simultaneously in an attended
and logged way. We need two little helper scripts:

launch-upgrades.sh
==================

	#!/bin/sh
	
	if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
		echo >&2 "Usage: $0 <hosts...>"
		exit 1
	fi
	
	PATH=/root/scripte/:$PATH
	
	echo >&2 "Jobs will be started inside tmux session. Do 'tmux attach' to interact"
	
	for host in "$@"; do
		host_e=$(printf %s "$host" | sed 's/[^0-9a-zA-Z_+-]/\\&/g')
		tmux-job "exec remembered-job run upgradehosts $host_e" upgrade-"$host"
	done


upgrade-host.sh
===============
	
	#!/bin/sh

	if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
		echo >&2 "Usage: $0 <host>"
		exit 1
	fi
	
	ssh -oConnectTimeout=3 -t -- "$1" "
		apt-get update && apt-get -u upgrade
	"
	ret=$?
	if [ "$ret" -ne 0 ]; then
		if ping -c 1 -w 2 "$1"; then
			exit "$ret"
		else
			echo
			echo "Host $1 seems to be down..."
		fi
	fi


Now let's prepare:

	remembered-job new upgradehosts 'exec upgrade-host.sh "$1"'
	remembered-job add upgradehosts <host>...

Replace <host>... with all the hostnames with which you want to launch upgrade
jobs, each host as a single argument.

To start an upgrade-session, type:

	launch-upgrades.sh $(remembered-job lsh upgradehosts)
