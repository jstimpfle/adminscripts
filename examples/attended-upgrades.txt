This example shows how to upgrade many clients simultaneously in an attended
and logged way. We define a little helper scripts to do the actual upgrade:

upgrade-host.sh
===============
	
	#!/bin/sh

	if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
		echo >&2 "Usage: $0 <host>"
		exit 1
	fi
	
	ssh -oConnectTimeout=3 -t -- "$1" "
		apt-get update && apt-get -u upgrade
	"
	ret=$?
	if [ "$ret" -ne 0 ]; then
		if ping -c 1 -w 2 "$1"; then
			exit "$ret"
		else
			echo
			echo "Host $1 seems to be down..."
		fi
	fi


Now let's prepare:

	remembered-job new upgradehosts 'exec upgrade-host.sh "$1"'
	remembered-job add upgradehosts 

Replace <host>... with all the hostnames with which you want to launch upgrade
jobs, each host as a single argument.

Let's start an upgrade session, all hosts sequentially:

	remembered-job run upgradehosts

Let's start an upgrade session for all hosts in parallel, inside a tmux session

	remembered-job tmux upgradehosts

We can also pick only certain hosts

	remembered-job run upgradehosts host1

or
	remembered-job tmux upgradehosts host1
